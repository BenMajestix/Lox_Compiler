# Lox_Compiler
I am working on an Integrator first for an programming Language called Lox. The Integrator is written in Java. 
After this basic Integrator will be done, I will start with an a little advanced real compiler written in C.
Thats why I am doing some little C Projects right now, I wanna start learn it and get comfortable around all that memory management.
